You can create a text file with a script that describes the location of rings, balls and their colors.
Each ball can be marked with a marker (letter or number) to make the puzzle harder to solve.
I have created files for all the ring puzzles, you can download them from the "Ring" folder.

You can make a marker on each ball (letters and numbers) so that each ball becomes unique. These puzzles are harder to solve.
